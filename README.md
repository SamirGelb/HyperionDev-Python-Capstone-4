Warehouse management project for a Nike shoe warehouse

Nike warehouses store the following information for each stock-taking list: 
● Country
● Code
● Product
● Cost
● Quantity 
● Value

Other store managers (in other regions) would like to be able to use this program to do the following:
● Search products by code.
● Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
● Determine the product with the highest quantity.
● Calculate the value of each item entry, based on the quantity and cost of the
item.
